### Yet Another Game Boy Emulator in Rust

YAGBER is a Game Boy emulator written in Rust. It is a work in progress and is far from being fully functional.

Currently it does not contain a GUI, but it can be used to run test ROMs.

It passes all instruction tests from the [Blaarg's test ROMs](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms).

See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for more information about the tests.

See [docs/scripts.md](docs/scripts.md) for more information about running the scripts present in the `scripts` directory.
